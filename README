A wrapper around pants that takes care of invoking pants from the root
of the repo with the target pointing back to the current working
directory. It also does some rewriting of goals (you can say 'clean'
instead of 'clean-all') and when you invoke the 'test' goal from a
src/... directory, points the target at the tests directory
corresponding to your current directory. If you don't like the wrapper
pun, you can also think of it as a way to skirt around using pants
directly.
